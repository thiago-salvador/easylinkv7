      },
      "linkDuration": {
        "question": "How long will my link stay online on the free plan?",
        "answer": "On the free plan, your link will remain active for 7 days. After this period, it will be automatically deactivated. To keep your links active for longer, we recommend upgrading to one of our paid plans, which offer permanent storage as long as your subscription is active."
      },
      "wordpress": {
        "question": "Do you support WordPress or similar CMS?",
        "answer": "EasyLink is optimized for hosting static sites, we don't offer support for WordPress or other CMS that require PHP or databases. However, if you export your WordPress site as static HTML (using plugins like Simply Static), you can host that content on our platform without issues."
      },
      "php": {
        "question": "Do you support PHP?",
        "answer": "No, currently EasyLink does not support PHP or other server languages. Our platform is optimized for static content, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you need dynamic functionality, we recommend using APIs and serverless services that can be integrated with your static site."
      },
      "publicAccess": {
        "question": "Are my links publicly accessible?",
        "answer": "By default, all EasyLink links are publicly accessible through the generated URL. However, in the Solo and Pro plans, we offer the option to protect your links with a password, allowing you to control who can access your content. You can also choose not to list your content in search engines."
      },
      "ecommerce": {
        "question": "Do you support e-commerce sites?",
        "answer": "EasyLink can host static e-commerce sites that use third-party services for payment processing, such as Stripe, PayPal, or other checkout solutions. You can create an online store using frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby with headless commerce integrations like Shopify, Snipcart, or Commerce.js."
      },
      "support": {
        "question": "What's the fastest way to get in touch if I need help?",
        "answer": "The fastest way to get help is through our support chat available on the website, which operates during business hours (9am to 6pm, Monday to Friday). You can also send an email to support@easylink.live and we'll respond within 24 hours. Pro plan customers have access to priority support with a guaranteed response time of 4 hours."
      },
      "moneyBack": {
        "question": "How does the 7-day money-back guarantee work?",
        "answer": "All our paid plans come with a 7-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with our service for any reason, simply contact our support team within 7 days of purchase, and we'll process a full refund without asking questions. Note that the guarantee applies only to your first subscription, not to renewals."
      },
      "cancel": {
        "question": "Can I cancel at any time?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time directly from your control panel. There are no long-term contracts or cancellation fees. After cancellation, you will continue to have access to your plan's features until the end of the current billing period."
      },
      "afterCancel": {
        "question": "What happens after I cancel?",
        "answer": "After cancellation, your account will remain active until the end of the current billing period. After that, your account will be downgraded to the free plan, and any features that exceed the free plan limits will become inaccessible. Your projects will remain in our system for 30 days after the end of your subscription, giving you time to back up your content or reactivate your subscription if you change your mind."
